<p>KairAlert is an &#39;Alpha Signal&#39; engine powered by AI, Big Data, and advanced algorithms, designed specifically for US stock market day traders, focusing on market news for low-price and small-cap stocks. After sourcing news, KairAlert processes it through a multi-layered, complex algorithm to categorize and filter, ultimately pushing only high-value news to our users.</p>
<img src="/assets/push_en.jpg" alt="KairAlert Screenshot" width="300">

<p>KairAlert clearly displays the event type, a core summary, the matched stock ticker, and basic info, allowing you to grasp all critical decision-making information in a second. Users of Tiger Brokers or Futu can also click through directly to the corresponding stock&#39;s chart.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Why Did We Build KairAlert?</h2>
<p>The market is flooded with over 20,000 news items every day from various sources. The vast majority of this is noise; very few stories are true catalysts for significant price volatility.
Traders consistently face several pain points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information Overload: Too many news items to read.</li>
<li>Lack of Filtering: Inability to filter out low-value &quot;noise.&quot;</li>
<li>Fragmented Sources: Inconvenience of switching between multiple channels to get the full picture.
KairAlert was built to solve these exact problems. It aggregates information from numerous sources, and its multi-layered algorithm classifies, analyzes, and filters every item. This &quot;Multi-Layered Complex Algorithm&quot; is more than just keyword matching; it integrates AI and NER (Named Entity Recognition) to truly understand the core event (e.g., identifying an FDA approval, distinguishing between beneficial financing and toxic dilution), and automatically clusters duplicate reports from different sources. This ensures you receive only the first-hand, high-value event itself.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>How is KairAlert Different from Traditional News Sites?</h2>
<p>Most traditional news sites focus on the news itself. They are weak on classification, core summarization, stock matching, and filtering. They can&#39;t push news to users with precision.
When using a traditional news site or broker app, the user must actively pull all news for a stock or the market, then manually categorize and filter it. With thousands of listed companies, it&#39;s impossible to actively find that critical, first-hand information quickly.
KairAlert does the exact opposite. It ingests as much news as possible, matches it to a ticker, and if it&#39;s deemed valuable by the algorithm, passively pushes it to the user. For the trader, this means you are passively receiving high-value, pre-filtered news. This dramatically saves time and increases the efficiency of capturing high-value information.</p>
<hr>
<h2>How many alerts does KairAlert send per day?</h2>
<p>The number varies daily, depending on the volume from upstream sources and the results of our algorithm. It could be anywhere from zero to several dozen.</p>
<hr>
<h2>What trading style is KairAlert suited for?</h2>
<p>KairAlert is designed for trading news-driven volatility. This means ultra short-term, &quot;in-and-out&quot; trades, often completed within minutes.
It focuses primarily on small-cap stocks (under $1B market cap) and pushes alerts related to: Mergers/Acquisitions, Financing, Strategic Partnerships, and FDA-related news.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Disclaimer: KairAlert is a news aggregation and filtering tool. Nothing in its feed constitutes investment advice. Ultra short-term trading carries extremely high risk; please make decisions based on your own judgment.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>Is KairAlert free?</h2>
<p>KairAlert is currently in its early product iteration and validation phase, and it is completely free to use.
We want this to be a zero-risk, no-barrier trial for you. No credit card or payment information is required. You can get started immediately.</p>
<p>We promise a free-use period of at least 3 months (starting from December 2025). During this time, we sincerely hope to receive your valuable feedback to help us refine and perfect KairAlert.</p>
<p>To provide you with a true &quot;Edge,&quot; KairAlert requires substantial, ongoing investment in several core areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Accessing and maintaining an extensive network of news feeds and massive amounts of market transaction data. This requires significant human and financial capital, as the vast majority of high-speed news channels and data sources are premium, paid services.</li>
<li>Continuously optimizing algorithmic strategies and Big Data models. This sustained R&amp;D investment is essential to guarantee comprehensive news coverage, ultra-low latency delivery, and unwavering service stability.</li>
<li>Supporting robust cloud infrastructure. Ensuring KairAlert operates 24/7 and processes massive volumes of data in real-time relies heavily on substantial resources in cloud computing, storage, and high-performance computing (HPC).</li>
<li>Ongoing product evolution. Rolling out new features, iterations, and maintenance requires continuous development resources.</li>
</ol>
<p>For these reasons, KairAlert will transition to a paid subscription service after the free trial period. However, we have not yet determined a clear pricing model.</p>
<hr>
