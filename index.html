        In today's market, timing is everything. By the time a headline hits social media, the opportunity is often
        gone. <br />
        KairAlert is designed to close this gap. We are not just a news aggregator; we are an Alpha Generation Engine.
        <br />
        Our mission is simple: to democratize access to professional market intelligence. We ensure independent day
        traders have the precision, speed, and clarity needed to make confident decisions in a fast-moving market.

      <ul class="list" id="js-faq-list">
        <li>
          <h4 class="title active">
            How is KairAlert Different from Traditional News Sites?
          </h4>
          <p class="desc active">
            Most traditional news sites focus on the news itself. They are weak on classification, core summarization,
            stock matching, and filtering.

            They can't push news to users with precision.<br /><br />

            When using a traditional news site or broker app, the user must actively pull all news for a stock or the
            market, then manually categorize and filter it.<br />

            With thousands of listed companies, it's impossible to actively find that critical, first-hand information
            quickly. <br /><br />

            KairAlert does the exact opposite. It ingests as much news as possible, matches it to a ticker, and if it's
            deemed valuable by the algorithm,
            passively pushes it to the user. For the trader, this means you are passively receiving high-value,
            pre-filtered news.
            This dramatically saves time and increases the efficiency of capturing high-value information.

          <h4 class="title">
            How many alerts does KairAlert send per day?
          </h4>
          <p class="desc">
            The number varies daily, depending on the volume from upstream sources and the results of our algorithm.
            <br /><br />
            It could be anywhere from zero to several dozen.
          </p>

        <li>
          <h4 class="title">
            What trading style is KairAlert suited for?
          </h4>
          <p class="desc">
            KairAlert is designed for trading news-driven volatility. This means ultra short-term, "in-and-out" trades,
            often completed within minutes.<br /><br />
            It focuses primarily on small-cap stocks (under $1B market cap) and pushes alerts related to:
            Mergers/Acquisitions, Financing, Strategic Partnerships, and FDA-related news.
            <br /><br />
            Disclaimer: KairAlert is a news aggregation and filtering tool. Nothing in its feed constitutes investment
            advice. Ultra short-term trading carries extremely high risk; please make decisions based on your own
            judgment.

          <h4 class="title">
            Is KairAlert free?
          </h4>
          <p class="desc">
            KairAlert is currently in its early product iteration and validation phase, and it is completely free to
            use.<br /><br />
            We want this to be a zero-risk, no-barrier trial for you. No credit card or payment information is required.
            You can get started immediately.<br /><br />

            We promise a free-use period of at least 3 months (starting from December 2025). During this time, we
            sincerely hope to receive your valuable feedback to help us refine and perfect KairAlert.<br /><br />

            To provide you with a true "Edge," KairAlert requires substantial, ongoing investment in several core
            areas:<br />
            1. Accessing and maintaining an extensive network of news feeds and massive amounts of market transaction
            data. This requires significant human and financial capital, as the vast majority of high-speed news
            channels and data sources are premium, paid services.<br />
            2. Continuously optimizing algorithmic strategies and Big Data models. This sustained R&D investment is
            essential to guarantee comprehensive news coverage, ultra-low latency delivery, and unwavering service
            stability.<br />
            3. Supporting robust cloud infrastructure. Ensuring KairAlert operates 24/7 and processes massive volumes of
            data in real-time relies heavily on substantial resources in cloud computing, storage, and high-performance
            computing (HPC).<br />
            4. Ongoing product evolution. Rolling out new features, iterations, and maintenance requires continuous
            development resources.<br />
            <br />
            For these reasons, KairAlert will transition to a paid subscription service after the free trial period.
            However, we have not yet determined a clear pricing model.
