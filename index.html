      <h2 class="section-title">Why Did We Build Edge Feed?</h2>
      <p class="desc">
        The market is flooded with over 20,000 news items every day from various sources.
        The vast majority of this is noise; very few stories are true catalysts for significant price volatility.
      </p>
      <p class="desc" style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
        Traders consistently face several pain points:

            <h3>Information Overload</h3>
            <p>
              With 20,000+ daily headlines, manual tracking is impossible. You risk missing "golden setups" buried under mountains of noise.
            </p>

            <h3>Ineffective Filtering</h3>
            <p>
              Standard filters fail to distinguish "rumors" from "facts." Wasting precious seconds verifying headlines costs you profit.
            </p>

            <h3>Fragmented Workflow</h3>

              Constantly switching tabs to monitor fragmented sources is slow. By the time you react, the price has likely already moved.

      <h2 class="section-title">FAQs</h2>
      <ul class="list" id="js-faq-list">
        <li>
          <h4 class="title active">
            How is Edge Feed Different from Traditional News Sites?
          </h4>
          <p class="desc active">
            Most traditional news sites focus on the news itself. They are weak on classification, core summarization, stock matching, and filtering.

            They can't push news to users with precision.<br/><br/>

            When using a traditional news site or broker app, the user must actively pull all news for a stock or the market, then manually categorize and filter it.<br/>

            With thousands of listed companies, it's impossible to actively find that critical, first-hand information quickly. <br/><br/>

            Edge Feed does the exact opposite. It ingests as much news as possible, matches it to a ticker, and if it's deemed valuable by the algorithm,
            passively pushes it to the user. For the trader, this means you are passively receiving high-value, pre-filtered news.
            This dramatically saves time and increases the efficiency of capturing high-value information.

          <h4 class="title">
            How many alerts does Edge Feed send per day?
          </h4>
          <p class="desc">
            The number varies daily, depending on the volume from upstream sources and the results of our algorithm. <br/><br/>
            It could be anywhere from zero to several dozen.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4 class="title">
            What trading style is Edge Feed suited for?
          </h4>
          <p class="desc">
            Edge Feed is designed for trading news-driven volatility. This means ultra short-term, "in-and-out" trades, often completed within minutes.<br/><br/>
            It focuses primarily on small-cap stocks (under $1B market cap) and pushes alerts related to: Mergers/Acquisitions, Financing, Strategic Partnerships, and FDA-related news.
            <br/><br/>
            Disclaimer: Edge Feed is a news aggregation and filtering tool. Nothing in its feed constitutes investment advice. Ultra short-term trading carries extremely high risk; please make decisions based on your own judgment.

        <li>
          <h4 class="title">
            Is Edge Feed free?
          </h4>
          <p class="desc">
            Edge Feed is currently in its early product iteration and validation phase, and it is completely free to use.<br/><br/>
            We want this to be a zero-risk, no-barrier trial for you. No credit card or payment information is required. You can get started immediately.<br/><br/>

            We promise a free-use period of at least 3 months (starting from December 2025). During this time, we sincerely hope to receive your valuable feedback to help us refine and perfect Edge Feed.<br/><br/>

            To provide you with a true "Edge," Edge Feed requires substantial, ongoing investment in several core areas:<br/>
            1. Accessing and maintaining an extensive network of news feeds and massive amounts of market transaction data. This requires significant human and financial capital, as the vast majority of high-speed news channels and data sources are premium, paid services.<br/>
            2. Continuously optimizing algorithmic strategies and Big Data models. This sustained R&D investment is essential to guarantee comprehensive news coverage, ultra-low latency delivery, and unwavering service stability.<br/>
            3. Supporting robust cloud infrastructure. Ensuring Edge Feed operates 24/7 and processes massive volumes of data in real-time relies heavily on substantial resources in cloud computing, storage, and high-performance computing (HPC).<br/>
            4. Ongoing product evolution. Rolling out new features, iterations, and maintenance requires continuous development resources.<br/>
            <br/>
            For these reasons, Edge Feed will transition to a paid subscription service after the free trial period. However, we have not yet determined a clear pricing model.

            What is on the future roadmap for Edge Feed?
          </h4>
          <p class="desc">
            Features currently on our roadmap include:<br/><br/>
            1. FDA Calendar: Alerts for key FDA dates and events.<br/>
            2. Large-Order Flow: Pushing alerts for potentially impactful large-order trades (focusing on SPY, QQQ, IWM, IWF, IWD, IWP, etc.).<br/>
            3. SEC Filings Monitor: Monitoring SEC filings (Forms 6-K, 8-K, 4) and alerting on high-value events.<br/>
            4. Unusual Volatility Alerts: Monitoring for and alerting on unusual stock movements.
